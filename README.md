Practicing Github

Hello, my name is Hyesoo Youn.
I am currently pursuing my PhD in Molecular and Cell Biology at UC Berkeley, with a concentration in Neurobiology. I thrive solving challenging problems, and particularly enjoy experimental design and data analysis. Through a career in industry, I aim to apply my knowledge and skill set to make the world a better place. In addition to working on my PhD, I enjoy practicing yoga, cooking, as well as learning about new topics.
